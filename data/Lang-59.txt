The bug was caused by incorrectly using the `getChars` method with the full length of the string `str` instead of the intended fixed width, leading to potential buffer overflow or data inconsistency when `strLen` exceeded `width`. The issue is evident in the `testLang299` unit test, where a `StrBuilder` initialized with a width of 1 is expected to append only the first character of the string `"foo"`, but instead appends more due to using `strLen`. The fix involves changing the end index in the `getChars` method to `width`, ensuring only the desired number of characters are appended, thereby preventing buffer overrun.
