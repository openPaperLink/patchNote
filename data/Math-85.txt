The bug in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils.java` arises from a condition that uses `fa * fb >= 0.0`, which incorrectly allows iteration when the product of `fa` and `fb` is exactly zero. In root-finding algorithms, `fa * fb < 0.0` indicates a root between the interval endpoints. The consequence is that if `fa * fb` equals zero, signaling that an endpoint is a root, the method fails to recognize it, potentially leading to a `ConvergenceException` after unnecessary iterations. Evidence of this issue is seen in the `testMath280` case, where the condition incorrectly handles an endpoint root, causing test failures. The fix changes the condition to `fa * fb > 0.0`, ensuring the algorithm correctly identifies zero-product scenarios as valid roots, preventing unnecessary exceptions and ensuring accurate convergence.
