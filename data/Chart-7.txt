The bug arises from incorrect usage of indices `maxMiddleIndex` and `minMiddleIndex` when retrieving start and end times of periods in the `TimePeriodValues` class. This leads to inaccurate calculation of the maximum middle time (`maxMiddle`), potentially causing test failures as demonstrated in tests like `testGetMaxMiddleIndex`, where expected and actual indices for maximum middle time period mismatch due to incorrect period data retrieved. The fix involves correcting the index usage to `maxMiddleIndex` to ensure accurate retrieval of period data, resulting in correct calculations and successful tests.
