The bug in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class's `getNumericalMean` method arises from integer division due to incorrect computational precedence. This results in a loss of precision in the mean calculation, particularly when multiplying `getSampleSize()` and `getNumberOfSuccesses()` exceeds integer limits. This leads to inaccurate results in calculations relying on the correct statistical mean, potentially misleading analyses. Evidence of the bug is the `testMath1021` test failure when using large parameters. The patch fixes this by performing division first with `(getNumberOfSuccesses() / (double) getPopulationSize())`, ensuring accurate floating-point division before multiplication to maintain precision.
