The bug in the `PiePlot` class is caused by an oversight in handling a null `dataset`, leading to potential `NullPointerException` when methods like `getMaximumExplodePercent` perform operations without checking for null. This is evidenced by tests such as `testDrawWithNullDataset`, which reveal the inability to render a pie chart when the dataset is null, causing program termination. The fix involves adding null checks within the affected methods, returning default values or skipping operations when the dataset is null, thereby preventing exceptions and ensuring robust pie chart rendering.
