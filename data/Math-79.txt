The bug in the `distance` method of the `MathUtils` class is due to the `sum` variable being incorrectly declared as an `int` instead of a `double`, leading to truncation and imprecise results during the accumulation of squared differences. This can cause inaccurate L<sub>2</sub> distance computations in precision-sensitive tasks such as KMeans clustering. Evidence of this issue is observed in failures during such precision-required calculations. The fix involves changing `sum` to a `double`, ensuring correct floating-point arithmetic for accurate Euclidean distance computation.
