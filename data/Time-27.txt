The bug was caused by not checking if both `iAfterParser` and `iAfterPrinter` were null within the `Separator` object. This oversight led to attempting to finalize a `Separator` with no valid printing or parsing logic, resulting in malformed or incomplete formatters. Consequently, it caused issues with period formatting, especially when dealing with optional elements or conditional separators, leading to incorrect parsing or printing, potential runtime exceptions, and logic errors in complex formats. The fix added a check to ensure these components are not null before using a `Separator` to finalize a `PeriodFormatter`, thereby preventing invalid formatter components and ensuring robust date-time operations.
