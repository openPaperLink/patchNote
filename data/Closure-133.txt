The bug in the `getRemainingJSDocLine` method of the `JsDocInfoParser` class arises from not resetting the `unreadToken` variable, causing inconsistent parsing states. This variable, if not reset, interferes with subsequent parsing operations, leading to incorrect or incomplete parsing of JSDoc comments, which affects functions requiring accurate JSDoc annotations and results in errors in type recognition. The issue is evidenced by the test case `testTextExtents`, where incorrect parsing can occur due to lingering tokens. The patch fixes the bug by resetting `unreadToken` to `NO_UNREAD_TOKEN` after acquiring the JSDoc line, ensuring the parser is properly reset for accurate parsing.
