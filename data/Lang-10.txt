The bug in the `FastDateParser` class arises from improper handling of whitespace when generating regular expressions in the `escapeRegex` method. This caused incorrect regex patterns, affecting parsing accuracy, particularly with input patterns like "M E" and values like "3  Tue", leading to mismatches. Evidence of this issue is demonstrated in the `testLANG_831` test case, which showed incorrect parsing results. The fix involves removing the faulty `wasWhite` flag and ceasing the indiscriminate addition of `\\s*+` for whitespaces, instead adopting a contextually accurate approach to ensure correct regex formulation without altering intended pattern structures.
