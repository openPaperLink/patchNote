The bug in the original code arose from using `allResultsMatch` instead of `anyResultsMatch` in the `mayBeString` method. This imposed a stricter condition, returning false if any evaluation path did not result in a string, potentially leading to false negatives. This misinterpretation affected optimization and type-checking, as evidenced in `testIssue821`, where mixed string and non-string results were incorrectly processed. The fix involved switching to `anyResultsMatch` to correctly identify nodes that might yield a string if any evaluation path returns a string, aligning the method with its intended logic and preventing inaccurate optimizations or type analyses.
