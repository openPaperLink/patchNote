The bug in the `FunctionRewriter` class's `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method arises because it only checks if nodes are function expressions and does not consider if they are part of an object literal's get or set key. This leads to incorrect identification and undesired transformation of these nodes, breaking the expected output, as evidence by the `testIssue538` test, which shows that getter methods such as `get name0()` are mistakenly altered. The fix involves adding a condition `&& !NodeUtil.isGetOrSetKey(n.getParent())` to ensure the method skips function expressions that are object literal accessors, preserving their intended functionality.
