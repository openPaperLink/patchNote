The bug in PeepholeFoldConstants arises from the improper handling of bitwise shift operations on negative integers, as JavaScript uses unsigned 32-bit integers, unlike Java. This leads to incorrect results when performing unsigned right shifts (>>>), as Java's `int` type doesn't represent the full unsigned 32-bit range. The consequence is incorrect outcomes for negative integers during bitwise operations, deviating from expected JavaScript behavior. Evidence for this issue includes unit tests like `testFoldBitShifts`, which check the results of operations such as "-1 >>> 1" and "-1 >>> 0", demonstrating failures without the patch. The fix involves using `long lvalLong = lvalInt & 0xffffffffL;` to convert the `int` to a `long`, ensuring it accurately represents an unsigned 32-bit number and aligns with JavaScript semantics.
