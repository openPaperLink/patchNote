The bug in the `CodeGenerator` class arises from the absence of handling for the null character (`\0`) in the switch statement responsible for escaping special characters in JavaScript code generation. This omission leads to unescaped null characters in output, potentially causing JavaScript syntax errors or unexpected behavior. The provided unit test, `testZero`, demonstrates this issue by verifying the incorrect handling of the null character. To fix it, a case for the null character (`\0`) should be added to the switch statement to ensure it is correctly escaped as `"\\0"`, thus preventing parsing errors.
