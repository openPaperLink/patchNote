The bug in the `caseObjectType` method arises from incorrect logic when handling objects whose `typeOf` value is `"function"`. The original code conditionally returned `ctorType` based on `resultEqualsValue` and whether `ctorType` was a subtype of `type`, leading to inconsistent type inference. Consequently, this bug results in incorrect type filtering, impacting type propagation and potentially causing misleading behavior in code analysis during `typeOf` checks. The issue is evidenced by unit tests such as `testTypeof3`, demonstrating incorrect inference of types like `U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE`.

The fix involves clearly separating the handling based on `resultEqualsValue`. If true, it returns the greatest subtype of `ctorType` and `type`. Otherwise, it checks and returns `null` when `type` is a subtype of `ctorType`, ensuring correct exclusion of subtypes. This enhancement ensures logical consistency in type inference, as confirmed by tests such as `testGoogIsFunction2`, verifying proper handling of subtype hierarchies and resolution of the bug.
