The bug stems from inadequate boundary checking when parsing the imaginary character in a complex number's string representation, which can lead to `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the input string is shorter than expected. This issue arises when the imaginary character, like "i" or "j", is missing, causing runtime errors by attempting to access invalid string indices, as demonstrated by the `testForgottenImaginaryCharacter` with inputs like "1 + 1". The problem is resolved by adding checks to ensure that `endIndex` does not exceed `source.length()`, preventing out-of-bounds access and ensuring correct parsing even with malformed or incomplete input strings.
