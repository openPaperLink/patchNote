The bug in the original `BrentSolver` code arises from an incorrect condition check for root bracketing, specifically using `sign >= 0`, which mistakenly prevents the identification of roots at endpoints when they are close to zero but not exactly zero. Consequently, the solver throws an `IllegalArgumentException` in valid cases where endpoints are near-zero roots, leading to overlooked legitimate roots and unexpected algorithm failure or incorrect results. Evidence of this bug is demonstrated in the test `testRootEndpoints`, which shows that valid roots like `Math.PI` at endpoints are misinterpreted due to the flawed logic. The fix involves changing the condition to `sign > 0` and adding checks for `Math.abs(yMin) <= functionValueAccuracy` and `Math.abs(yMax) <= functionValueAccuracy` to accurately identify and handle endpoints as roots when they are sufficiently close to zero, preventing unnecessary exceptions.
