The bug in the `SimplexSolver` class was caused by an incorrect condition using `MathUtils.compareTo(entry, 0, epsilon) >= 0`, which allowed zero entries as pivot candidates, risking division by zero and resulting in undefined behavior. This led to unpredictable optimization results and potential failures in solving linear programming problems, as evidenced by the unit test `testMath288`, which could fail to reach the correct solution under the flawed condition. The bug was fixed by changing the condition to `MathUtils.compareTo(entry, 0, epsilon) > 0`, ensuring only positive entries are chosen for pivot selection, thus maintaining the algorithm's correctness and stability.
