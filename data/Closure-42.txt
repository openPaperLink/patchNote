The bug in the `IRFactory` class was due to a lack of handling for the `for each` loop construct in JavaScript, causing the `processForInLoop` method to incorrectly transform this construct in the AST, potentially resulting in syntax errors or runtime exceptions. Evidence of this issue is found in the test case `testForEach`, which expects an error when encountering a `for each` loop. The fix involves adding a check for the `for each` construct using `loopNode.isForEach()`, reporting an error with `errorReporter`, and returning a minimal expression result node to maintain AST integrity and enforce the unsupported status of the `for each` loop.
