The bug arises from a missing check for the `options.skipAllPasses` condition when determining whether to reorder sources based on dependency management. This oversight allowed unnecessary operations to be performed even when all compiler passes should have been skipped, leading to inefficiencies or incorrect build configurations. Evidence of this issue appeared in the "testDependencySortingWhitespaceMode" test, which highlighted incorrect operations under a `WHITESPACE_ONLY` compilation level. The fix introduced by the patch adds a conditional check for `!options.skipAllPasses`, ensuring that dependency reordering occurs only if dependency management is needed and all passes have not been explicitly disabled.
