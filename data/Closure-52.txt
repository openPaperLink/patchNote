**Cause of the Bug:**  
The bug stems from incomplete validation in the `CodeGenerator` class, where strings with positive length were considered valid without checking their content. This oversight allowed strings beginning with '0' to be misprocessed.

**Consequences of the Bug:**  
This issue affects JavaScript object's numeric keys, where strings starting with '0' might be interpreted as octal literals, leading to incorrect key representation or compilation, and causing subtle errors in code conversion or optimization.

**Evidence of the Bug:**  
Unit test `testNumericKeys` exposed the bug, showing that keys like "010" and "0x10" were misprocessed. These tests revealed discrepancies in expected outputs for numeric keys, which were supposed to be treated as decimal numbers or preserved as string literals.

**How to Fix it:**  
The fix involves adding a validation check for the presence of a leading '0'. By adjusting the condition to `s.charAt(0) != '0'`, the patch ensures correct processing by excluding strings starting with '0', aligning with JavaScript's handling of numeric string keys.
