The bug in this code arises from inadequate handling of negative zero in JavaScript code generation. The original logic only considered cases where `x` was less than `0` when adding a space after a minus sign, neglecting the distinct value of negative zero. This oversight led to incorrect code generation for expressions involving negative zero, resulting in potential logic errors or unexpected behavior in JavaScript execution environments. The consequence is particularly noted in tests like `testMinusNegativeZero`, which failed due to improper handling of such cases. The fix involves updating the condition to check for both negative numbers and negative zero using `(x < 0 || negativeZero)`, ensuring that the space is added appropriately. This patch corrects the output format and allows the `testMinusNegativeZero` to pass, validating the fix.
