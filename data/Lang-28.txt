The bug in the `NumericEntityUnescaper` class was caused by improper handling of numeric entity values greater than 0xFFFF, which represent supplementary characters requiring two `char` values (a surrogate pair) in Java. The original implementation incorrectly wrote these values directly to the output, leading to data loss or corruption. This resulted in broken or malformed character data, affecting text display or processing. Evidence of this bug was shown in the `testSupplementaryUnescaping` test case, where the entity `&#68642;` failed to translate to its expected UTF-16 surrogate pair `"\uD803\uDC22"`. The fix involves checking if `entityValue` exceeds 0xFFFF and using `Character.toChars(entityValue)` to convert it to a surrogate pair, ensuring the correct Unicode representation is written to the output.
