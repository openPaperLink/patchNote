The bug was caused by using an incorrect boundary condition in power computations, specifically using `TWO_POWER_52` instead of `TWO_POWER_53` to check the magnitude of the `y` argument. This led to edge cases with very large even `y` values not being handled correctly, especially when `y` exceeded 2^53, causing inaccuracies in calculations like `FastMath.pow(-1, y)`. Evidence of this bug surfaced in the unit test `testMath904`, where the results diverged from Java's `Math.pow` standards. The fix involved updating the condition to use `TWO_POWER_53` to ensure the optimized path for power calculations is correctly identified, aligning the behavior of `FastMath.pow` with `Math.pow` and resolving inaccuracies.
