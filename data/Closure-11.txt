The bug is caused by a bypass condition in the type-checking logic for assignments, where the code prematurely skips type validations when node type information is non-null and the parent is an assignment, overlooking invalid property accesses such as setting properties on a `null` value. This oversight leads to undetected illegal assignments during runtime and static analysis, compromising type safety. Evidence includes failing unit tests like `testGetprop4`, which should raise errors for illegal property accesses but doesn't due to this bypass condition. The fix involves removing the short-circuit logic to ensure all type validations, including those in assignment statements, are consistently applied, preventing illegal assignments from bypassing crucial checks.
