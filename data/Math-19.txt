The bug in the CMAESOptimizer arises from the absence of validation for potential overflow when computing boundary differences, specifically when `boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i]` might result in infinite values. This overflow can lead to unexpected exceptions or incorrect optimization results, as the optimizer may surpass numeric limits. The consequence is significant because it could cause the optimizer to fail unexpectedly during function minimization when handling excessively large boundary constraints, thereby invalidating the optimization results. Evidence of this bug is found in the `testBoundaryRangeTooLarge` test case, which initially causes inaccuracies or failures when using boundaries exceeding `Double.MAX_VALUE / 2`. The proposed fix involves checking before operations to ensure the boundary difference is not infinite, and if it is, a `NumberIsTooLargeException` is thrown to prevent overflow, maintaining the optimizer's reliability and accuracy.
