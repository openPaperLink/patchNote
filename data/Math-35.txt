The bug in the original code arises from directly assigning `this.elitismRate` in the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, bypassing the necessary validation to ensure the value is within the [0, 1] range. The consequences include the risk of setting an invalid elitism rate, which can lead to exceptions and undefined behavior during population processing. Evidence of this issue is highlighted by tests such as `testConstructorTooHigh` and `testConstructorTooLow`, which failed without validation but passed after the fix. The patch resolves the issue by replacing direct assignment with a call to `setElitismRate(elitismRate)`, using its validation logic to ensure a valid elitism rate and consistent class behavior.
