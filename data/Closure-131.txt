The bug in the original code arises from not checking for "identifier-ignorable" characters as specified by Java when validating JavaScript identifiers. This oversight leads to strings with such characters being incorrectly identified as valid, causing parsing errors and incorrect behavior in dependent code. Evidence of the bug is shown in test cases like `testQuotedProps` and `testDoNotConvert`, which previously failed with identifiers containing special Unicode characters but passed after the patch. The fix involves adding checks for identifier-ignorable characters both at the beginning and within the loop, ensuring these characters are disallowed and aligning with JavaScript and Java identifier standards.
