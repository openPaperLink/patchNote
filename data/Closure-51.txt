The bug in the `CodeConsumer` class is caused by the handling of `-0.0`, where the original check `(long) x == x` fails to differentiate between positive and negative zero, leading to incorrect treatment of negative zero as `0`. This results in errors where the sign of zero is significant, potentially causing incorrect behavior in mathematical operations and JavaScript code generation. The unit test `testIssue582` highlights the issue by failing to correctly handle `-0.0`. The fix involves using the `isNegativeZero` method to explicitly check for negative zero, ensuring accurate representation and output of floating-point numbers.
