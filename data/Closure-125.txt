The bug arises from the original code's failure to verify if a `FunctionType` has an instance type during JavaScript type checks, potentially leading to incorrect type handling. This can result in misinterpretation of types, where non-instance function types may be treated as having an instance, affecting functionality dependent on accurate type checking. Evidence of this issue is demonstrated by the failure of the `testIssue1002` test case, where constructors are incorrectly processed without an instance type. The fix involves adding a check using the `hasInstanceType()` method on `FunctionType`, ensuring operations only proceed with valid instance types to maintain accurate type associations and adhere to JavaScript type system constraints.
