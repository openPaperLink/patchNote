The bug was caused by calculating a `Range` object for the width constraint without ensuring the lower bound was non-negative, leading to an invalid state when the width constraint was less than the block width (`w[2]`). This resulted in unexpected behavior or rendering errors in applications, with tests like `testSizingWithWidthConstraint` failing due to negative dimensions. The fix involved using `Math.max(constraint.getWidth() - w[2], 0.0)` to ensure the range's lower bound was at least zero, preventing negative sizing constraints and ensuring proper component rendering.
