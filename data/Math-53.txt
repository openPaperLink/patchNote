The bug was caused by the absence of a NaN check in the `add` method of the `Complex` class, allowing arithmetic operations with NaN components as if they were valid numbers. Consequently, this oversight led to incorrect complex numbers when involving a NaN, contrary to the expected behavior that any operation with NaN should yield a NaN result. Evidence of the issue is shown in the `testAddNaN` unit test, which highlights that adding a NaN complex number to a valid number should result in NaN, but the lack of checks led to incorrect computations. To fix this, a NaN check was introduced at the start of the `add` method to return a NaN complex number if either operand is NaN, ensuring compliance with mathematical rules for NaN operations.
