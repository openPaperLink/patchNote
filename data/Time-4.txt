The bug in the `Partial` class arises from the misuse of the constructor `Partial(Chronology chronology, DateTimeFieldType[] types, int[] values)` in the `with` method, which fails to validate that the `types` array is ordered and free from duplicates. This can cause violations of the `Partial` object's contract, leading to exceptions and failures in methods that require properly ordered field type arrays. Evidence of the bug is found in the failing test `testWith3`, which demonstrates the creation of a misconfigured `Partial` instance due to the unvalidated constructor bypassing checks. The fix involves using the validated constructor `Partial(DateTimeFieldType[] types, int[] values, Chronology chronology)` within the `with` method to enforce necessary consistency checks, thus maintaining the object's integrity.
