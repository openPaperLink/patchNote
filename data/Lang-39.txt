The bug arises from not handling `null` values in the `searchList` and `replacementList` arrays, leading to potential `NullPointerException` during length calculations. This can cause runtime exceptions, disrupting application flow and resulting in crashes or errors during string manipulations using the `replaceEach` method. Evidence is found in unit tests like `testReplace_StringStringArrayStringArray`, which demonstrate expected behavior with `null` elements, emphasizing the need for null handling. The fix involves adding a conditional check to skip processing if either the search or replacement element is `null`, preventing `NullPointerException` and ensuring the function remains null-safe.
