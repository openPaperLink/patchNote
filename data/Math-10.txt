The bug in the `DSCompiler` arises from the improper handling of special numeric cases, such as zero values with different signs (+0, -0) and infinite values, when computing the arc tangent using the `atan2` method. This leads to incorrect results in trigonometric operations, affecting computations requiring precise angle determination and causing inaccuracies in applications involving coordinates and angles.

Evidence of the bug is demonstrated by the unit test `testAtan2SpecialCases`, which previously failed to return mathematically correct results for special input cases, like producing Ï€ for (+0.0, -0.0) or 0 with a negative sign for (-0.0, +0.0).

The issue is resolved by using `FastMath.atan2`, which appropriately manages these special input cases and accurately computes the arc tangent, thereby ensuring mathematically consistent results and enhancing the robustness of trigonometric calculations.
