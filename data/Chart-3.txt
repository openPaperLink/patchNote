The bug in the `TimeSeries` class is due to incorrect initialization of the `minY` and `maxY` fields when cloning a `TimeSeries` object via the `createCopy()` method, resulting in the cloned instance potentially retaining outdated values. This can lead to incorrect calculations or behavior in operations that depend on these values, such as graphical rendering or statistical analysis, causing misleading outcomes. Evidence for this bug comes from tests like `testCreateCopy3`, which reveal that cloned objects might not correctly reflect the `minY` and `maxY` values without proper initialization. To fix the issue, the `minY` and `maxY` fields of the cloned object are set to `Double.NaN`, ensuring they are recalculated based on the data in the clone, thus preserving accuracy in computations relying on y-value extremes.
