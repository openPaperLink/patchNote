The bug is caused by improperly setting `seriesKeys` and `categoryKeys` to `null` when initializing an empty dataset, leading to potential `NullPointerException` since methods assume these arrays are always non-null. Additionally, there's a mismatch in the validation check for the number of categories against the `startData` array's length, causing incorrect `IllegalArgumentException` when `categoryKeys` is zero-length but non-null. Evidence from the `testSetCategoryKeys` shows failures when setting category keys to an empty array, demonstrating the expectation for non-null arrays. Other tests like `testGetCategoryIndex` and `testGetRowCount` also support the need for consistent handling of empty datasets. The fix involves initializing `seriesKeys` and `categoryKeys` as zero-length arrays instead of `null` and updating the validation to use `getCategoryCount()`, thus removing null checks and ensuring accurate validations.
