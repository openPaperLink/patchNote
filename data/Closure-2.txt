The bug in the original `TypeCheck` code arises from a potential `NullPointerException` occurring when `getImplicitPrototype()` returns `null` due to the `interfaceType` being a proxy to a non-existent object, stemming from incorrect type annotations in JavaScript code. This can cause the entire JavaScript compilation process to crash unexpectedly, halting further code analysis or transformations, which is particularly problematic for large codebases. Evidence for this issue is demonstrated by the unit test `testBadInterfaceExtendsNonExistentInterfaces`, which shows that while bad type annotations should emit warnings, they should not lead to a crash. The fix involves checking for `null` in `implicitProto` and, if `null`, assigning an empty set to `currentPropertyNames`, thus preventing operations on a `null` object and allowing type checks to proceed without disruption.
