The bug was caused by an incorrect calculation of the variable `j` in the loop boundary condition, originally computed as `4 * n - 1` instead of the intended `4 * (n - 1)`, leading to the misalignment with the intended array segment. This resulted in the loop potentially corrupting the work array by overstepping into unintended areas, which could then produce incorrect eigen decomposition results, namely inaccurate eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Evidence of the bug was seen in the failing test case `testMathpbx02`, which highlighted the discrepancies in computed and reference eigenvalues due to this mismanagement of the work array. The fix implemented was to adjust the calculation of `j` to `4 * (n - 1)`, correctly aligning the loop to the intended array boundaries, thereby ensuring the integrity of the eigen decomposition results.
