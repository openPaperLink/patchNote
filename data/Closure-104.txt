The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of `NO_TYPE` in the `UnionType` class when building a union type. The original code only checks if `result` is non-null and fails to account for `NO_TYPE`, potentially leading to its unintended propagation as valid. The consequence is that union types could be incorrectly computed, causing type mismatch issues, especially when a union is meant to represent an empty or invalid set of types. Evidence is found in scenarios like the `testGreatestSubtypeUnionTypes5` unit test, where the computation yields invalid results due to `NO_TYPE` being misidentified. The fix involves changing the condition from `result != null` to `!result.isNoType()` to correctly distinguish between valid types, null results, and `NO_TYPE`, thereby preventing its unintended propagation.
