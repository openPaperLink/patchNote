The bug in the `CategoryPlot` and `XYPlot` classes arises from the absence of a null check for the `markers` variable before attempting to remove a marker, leading to a `NullPointerException` if the `markers` list is null due to no markers being added for a specific domain or range index.

The consequences include potential runtime exceptions that disrupt program execution, causing breakdowns in plot functionality and unexpected application behavior or crashes when marker removal is attempted without any markers present.

Evidence of the issue is found in unit tests such as `testRemoveDomainMarker` and `testRemoveRangeMarker`, which now pass using assertions to verify that the function does not throw exceptions and correctly returns `false` when no markers are present to remove.

The fix involves adding a null check for `markers` and returning `false` if it is null. This prevents calling `remove` on a null list, avoiding `NullPointerException`, while signaling that no marker was removed, thus maintaining expected behavior.
