The bug in the `revert` method arises from incorrectly reversing the direction of a line by subtracting the direction vector from a zero vector, potentially altering the line's intrinsic properties, such as its zero point. This causes the reverted line to inaccurately represent the reverse of the original line, impacting computations relying on correct line orientation. Evidence of the bug is shown in the `testRevert` unit test, which fails because the original method incorrectly modifies the line's zero point. The fix involves directly negating the direction vector on a copied instance of the line using a copy constructor, ensuring only the direction is reversed without affecting other properties.
