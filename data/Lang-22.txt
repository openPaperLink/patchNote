The bug in the `greatestCommonDivisor` method in `Fraction.java` was caused by its inability to handle cases where `u` or `v` is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, as the value cannot be negated within integer bounds, leading to potential overflow. This oversight could result in unexpected results or overflow when the method encountered `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, potentially causing an `ArithmeticException`. The issue was evidenced by unexpected exceptions in tests like `testReduce` and `testReducedFactory_int_int`. The fix involved checking if either operand is 0 or `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and throwing an `ArithmeticException` in the latter case. Additionally, it handles zero arguments by returning the sum of the absolute values, preventing undefined behavior.
