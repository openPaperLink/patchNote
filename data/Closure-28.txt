The bug in the `InlineCostEstimator` class stems from inadequate handling of constants (`true`, `false`, `null`) during cost estimation, leading to inaccurate inline cost assessments. This mismanagement resulted in suboptimal inlining decisions by the compiler, potentially increasing code size or degrading performance, as constants were not contributing correctly to cost estimations, affecting overall JavaScript code efficiency. The discrepancy was highlighted by the `testCost`, which revealed inaccuracies in cost determination. The fix involves overriding the `addConstant` method to use `add("0")`, effectively treating constants as minimal or zero-cost, thus aligning cost estimates with expected optimization behaviors and ensuring accurate inlining decisions. The effectiveness of this fix is validated by the successful passage of the `testCost` unit test.
