The bug arises because the `getBasicRow` method may return a row index of `0`, representing the objective function row, which was not explicitly handled, leading to incorrect coefficient adjustments for unconstrained variables in the objective function. This results in failures during optimization scenarios, producing incorrect simplex tableau states and affecting computations like finding feasible solutions or optimal values, as demonstrated in the `testMath713NegativeVariable` test, where negative values were incorrectly allowed. The fix involves adding a condition to handle `basicRow == 0`, setting the coefficient to `0` to prevent unconstrained variables from affecting the optimization process improperly, ensuring correct optimization results.
