The bug in the `MathUtils.gcd` method is caused by an incorrect zero value check using `if (u * v == 0)`, which can lead to integer overflow and unreliable results for large numbers. This results in potentially returning a non-zero GCD when one of the inputs is zero, as the method might proceed with GCD calculations assuming non-zero values due to overflow. Evidence is found in test cases that confirm GCD calculations should return the absolute value of the non-zero input or zero when both inputs are zero. The fix involves directly checking if either `u` or `v` is zero using `if ((u == 0) || (v == 0))` to avoid multiplication and overflow issues, ensuring accurate results.
