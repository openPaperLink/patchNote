The bug occurs because the expression `FastMath.pow(2 * FastMath.PI, -dim / 2)` uses integer division, causing truncation of the exponent since `dim` is an integer. This leads to incorrect results for the probability density function (PDF) of the multivariate normal distribution, especially in higher dimensions. Evidence of the bug is found in the `testUnivariateDistribution` unit test, which shows failures when comparing results against the univariate normal distribution implementation. The fix involves using `-0.5 * dim` instead, ensuring floating-point arithmetic is used for the exponent to prevent truncation and maintain mathematical accuracy.
