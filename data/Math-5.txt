The bug was caused by returning NaN when calculating the reciprocal of a complex number with both real and imaginary parts equal to zero, contradicting the mathematical convention that the reciprocal of zero is undefined and should be represented by infinity. This inconsistency led to incorrect results, particularly in scenarios like the test `testReciprocalZero`, which expected the reciprocal to return Complex.INF. The patch fixes the issue by changing the return value from NaN to INF, aligning with mathematical conventions and ensuring consistent handling of zero reciprocal computations across the application.
