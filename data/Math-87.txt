The bug in `SimplexTableau` arises from the `getBasicRow` method's incorrect condition that checked for non-zero column values without confirming if they truly constituted a basis column, due to not rigorously comparing values to 1 or checking for uniqueness. This leads to incorrect basic row assignments, potentially causing the Simplex method to yield incorrect or non-optimal solutions that fail to meet problem constraints. The evidence of this issue is apparent in tests like `testSingleVariableAndConstraint`, where the solver should provide precise optimal values but doesn't due to the faulty condition. To fix the bug, the condition was revised to ensure that entries are precisely equal to 1.0 using `MathUtils.equals` and confirmed to be unique among non-zero values, addressing floating-point imprecision and ensuring valid basis column identification.
