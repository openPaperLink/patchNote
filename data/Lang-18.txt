The bug in `FastDateFormat.java` arose from incorrect logic in handling year patterns during date formatting, specifically mishandling a two-character year pattern by using the same rule as for patterns of four or more characters. This caused dates with a two-character year pattern to display incorrectly, violating expected formatting standards and leading to potential logical errors in applications relying on these date representations.

Evidence of the bug was found in unit test outputs comparing `FastDateFormat` and `SimpleDateFormat`, which showed mismatches in formatted dates with two-character year patterns. The fix involved adjusting the conditional logic to correctly apply `TwoDigitYearField.INSTANCE` for two-character year tokens and using `selectNumberRule` for longer patterns, ensuring compatibility with `SimpleDateFormat`.
