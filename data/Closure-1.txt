The bug in `RemoveUnusedVars.java` is caused by the lack of a check to return immediately if `removeGlobals` is set to `false`. This oversight leads to the unintended removal of unused function arguments, even when global variables are not being removed, potentially altering function behavior and breaking API contracts. The consequences are evident in the failed tests like `testRemoveGlobal2`, `testRemoveGlobal1`, and `testRemoveGlobal3`, which expected function parameters to remain intact. The fix introduces an early return when `removeGlobals` is `false`, ensuring arguments are retained as intended, demonstrated by the passing of the previously failing tests.
