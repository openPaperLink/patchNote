The bug arises from the incorrect use of `mLocale` when initializing the `GregorianCalendar`, leading to inconsistencies in date formatting where locale-specific data is not needed. The consequence is illustrated by the unit test `testLang645`, which fails to produce the expected week designation due to unexpected locale influence on calendar computations. The evidence is the failing test. To fix it, the locale parameter is removed from the `GregorianCalendar` constructor to prevent undesired locale effects, ensuring consistent behavior across different locales while focusing on time zone correctness.
