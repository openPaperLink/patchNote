The bug in the original code of the `cumulativeProbability` method in `NormalDistributionImpl` arises from assuming that the `Erf.erf` computation always converges. This leads to a `MaxIterationsExceededException` for extreme `x` values (more than 20 standard deviations from the mean), which was not handled, causing runtime exceptions.

The consequence of this bug is significant, as it disrupts calculations of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for extreme `x` values. Instead of returning `0` for values far below the mean or `1` for values far above, the method throws exceptions, potentially causing failures in dependent applications and processes.

Evidence of the bug is seen in the `testExtremeValues`, which shows that for `x` values further than 10 standard deviations from the mean, the method fails to return the expected CDF approximations, throwing exceptions instead.

The fix involves wrapping the error function computation in a `try-catch` block. If a `MaxIterationsExceededException` occurs, the method checks if `x` is more than 20 standard deviations from the mean, returning `0.0` or `1.0` as appropriate. This ensures correct behavior for extreme inputs while rethrowing exceptions for other issues.
