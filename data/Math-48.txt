The bug in the `BaseSecantSolver` class when implementing the Regula Falsi method arises because there is no condition to detect convergence when the current point `x` equals the previous `x1`, potentially leading to an infinite loop. The consequences are severe, as the solver could run indefinitely, consuming resources and blocking other processes, evidenced by the `testIssue631` unit test, which could stall or timeout. The fix is to introduce a check within the REGULA_FALSI case, throwing a `ConvergenceException` when `x` equals `x1`, detecting the non-progressing state early and preventing infinite loops.
