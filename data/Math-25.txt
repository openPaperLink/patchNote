The bug in the `HarmonicFitter` class is caused by the absence of a check for a zero denominator when using the variable `c2`, leading to division by zero during amplitude and angular frequency calculation. This results in runtime exceptions or incorrect fitting parameters, compromising the curve fitting process, particularly in ill-conditioned scenarios referenced by issue MATH-844. Evidence of this bug is observed in the `testMath844` scenario where data points cause `c2` to be zero, leading to unhandled conditions. The fix involves introducing a guard clause to check if `c2` is zero. If it is, a `MathIllegalStateException` is thrown to prevent errors and inform the user about unsuitable data configuration.
