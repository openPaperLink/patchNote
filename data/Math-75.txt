The bug in the `Frequency` class arises because the `getPct(Object v)` method incorrectly calls `getCumPct((Comparable<?>) v)` instead of `getPct((Comparable<?>) v)`. This causes it to return cumulative percentages rather than exact percentages, which misleads users who expect precise equal-value percentages. The consequence is that statistical analysis becomes flawed, leading to potential misinterpretations and decisions based on inaccurate data. Unit tests, such as `testPcts`, reveal this issue by showing deviations from expected results when evaluating the logic of the `getPct` method. The patch fixes the problem by changing the `getPct(Object v)` method to call `getPct((Comparable<?>) v)`, ensuring the correct percentage calculations for values equal to `v`.
