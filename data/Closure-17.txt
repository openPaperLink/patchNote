The bug arises from an oversight in handling the right-hand side (rValue) type during type inference, where types explicitly provided in JSDoc comments were overlooked, leading to inaccurate type assignments. This resulted in potential mismatches in expected types, causing incorrect type-based operations or annotations, as demonstrated by the `testIssue688`, which highlighted an inconsistency in return types due to a missed JSDoc-annotated type. The fix involves prioritizing JSDoc type information over existing type checks when available, ensuring accurate type identification and preventing the original issue of inconsistent return types.
