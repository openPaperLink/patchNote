The bug in `parseContextTypeExpression` in `JsDocInfoParser.java` was due to improper handling of the `?` (QMARK) token, as the method always called `parseTypeName(token)`, which failed to accurately process `?` in context type expressions. The bug resulted in misinterpretation of types, particularly for expressions like `function (new:?)`, causing errors in recognizing constructors and handling type information, as seen in test failures such as `testStructuralConstructor2` and `testStructuralConstructor3`. Evidence of this bug was found in unit tests like `testStructuralConstructor2`, which failed due to incorrect handling of the `new:?` structure. The fix involved adding a condition to check for the QMARK token and returning a `QMARK` node before invoking `parseBasicTypeExpression(token)`, ensuring that `?` is correctly interpreted and the related tests pass as expected.
