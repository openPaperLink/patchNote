The bug in the `ValueMarker` class arises from incorrect parameters being passed to its superclass constructor, `Marker`. Instead of using the `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` parameters, it mistakenly reuses `paint` and `stroke`, leading to incorrect initialization in the `Marker` class. This results in the `ValueMarker` being rendered incorrectly, with its outline properties mirroring the main properties and therefore losing their intended distinctiveness, which could confuse users. Evidence from the test case `test1808376` shows a failure in assertions that expected `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` to be different from `paint` and `stroke`, confirming the improper initializations. The fix involves correctly passing `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` to the `Marker` superclass, ensuring the proper distinction is maintained between the primary and outline attributes.
