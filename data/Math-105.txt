The bug in the `SimpleRegression` class's `getSumSquaredErrors()` method arose from calculations that could produce a negative sum of squared errors (SSE) due to rounding errors or numerical inaccuracies. Consequences included incorrect statistical interpretations and downstream calculations, impacting model evaluations or ANOVA statistics. Evidence of the bug was demonstrated by a unit test, `testSSENonNegative`, which failed when SSE was negative in certain scenarios. The fix involved using `Math.max(0d, sumYY - sumXY * sumXY / sumXX)` to ensure the method returns a non-negative value, aligning with the expected mathematical definition of SSE.
