The bug arises from the lack of handling for single-element input arrays `a` and `b`. Without this, the code performs unnecessary and potentially erroneous complex computations instead of simple scalar multiplication. This inefficiency can lead to incorrect results or wasted resources, particularly affecting systems that require precise calculations or have performance constraints.

Evidence of the bug is demonstrated in the unit test `testLinearCombinationWithSingleElementArray`, which fails to correctly compute the product `a[0] * b[0]` without the patch.

The fix involves adding a conditional check for single-element arrays, allowing the method to directly return `a[0] * b[0]`, ensuring both correctness and efficiency for this edge case.
