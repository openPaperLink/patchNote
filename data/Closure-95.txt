The bug arises because the original code mishandles declarations of qualified names (`Token.GETPROP`) within non-global scopes, failing to properly consider when these names should be declared in the global scope instead. This misplacement leads to missing or incomplete type information globally, causing incorrect behavior during type inference or type checking, adversely affecting scenarios where other parts of the code rely on global presence of such qualified names. Evidence for this issue is seen in failed unit tests like `testGlobalQualifiedNameInLocalScope` and `testQualifiedNameInference5`, where the absence of global declarations inhibits type correctness and enforcement. The fix checks if qualified names should be globally scoped using `isQnameRootedInGlobalScope(n)`, then appropriately declares them in the global scope if not already done, ensuring accurate type checking and inference.
