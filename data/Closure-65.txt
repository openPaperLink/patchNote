The bug arises from using an inadequate escape sequence for the null character ('\0') in JavaScript string literals, leading to potential misinterpretation and incorrect behavior. This can result in syntax errors or malfunctioning of the application when the generated code fails to parse or execute correctly. Evidence is provided by the unit test `testZero`, which shows that various representations of the zero character are not correctly transformed into a universally recognized escape sequence. The fix is to change the escape sequence from "\\0" to "\\000", ensuring a three-digit octal escape sequence that is more reliably interpreted by JavaScript engines.
