The bug in the `matchConstraint` method of the `PrototypeObjectType` class was caused by constraints being matched for all types, including those with a reference name. This was incorrect because constraints should only be matched for anonymous types. As a result, it could lead to incorrect type deductions and unpredictable behavior in the compiler, as seen in tests like `testIssue700`. The fix includes adding a check using the `hasReferenceName` method to ensure the method only proceeds with anonymous types, thereby preventing unnecessary and incorrect constraint matches on named types.
