The bug in the `BigFraction` and `Fraction` classes arises from insufficient checks on the maximum allowed denominator (`maxDenominator`) during fraction conversion, causing potential overflow when `epsilon` isn't appropriately considered. This led to unnecessary `FractionConversionException` occurrences when an exact fraction representation was possible without exceeding the maximum denominator, disrupting applications reliant on precise fractions.

Evidence of the bug was shown in failed unit tests like `testDigitLimitConstructor`, which highlighted the improper exception handling before the patch. The fix implemented adds a conditional check to exit the loop if `epsilon` is zero and `q1` is below `maxDenominator`, preventing unnecessary exceptions and allowing valid constructions, thus ensuring reliability and correctness in fractional calculations.
