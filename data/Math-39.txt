The bug in the `EmbeddedRungeKuttaIntegrator` arises from the step size `hNew` not being constrained properly, which can lead to overshooting the target time `t` during the final integration step. This can disrupt the integration's accuracy and correctness, especially in edge cases where `t` is near `stepStart`, and may result in incorrect results or backward integration when `forward` is false. The evidence for this bug is the unit test `testTooLargeFirstStep`, which shows that the original implementation exceeded specified bounds, causing test failures. To fix the bug, the code adjusts `stepSize` to ensure it does not surpass `t`, aligning the computed step size with the target and maintaining integration precision.
