The bug arises from incorrect conditional logic in the `CommandLineRunner.createOptions()` method, where the `closurePass` option was set within a conditional block instead of being directly assigned from `flags.process_closure_primitives`. This misconfiguration could lead to improper handling of Closure-library primitives like `goog.require`, resulting in errors during code compilation. Evidence of this issue is found in the `testProcessClosurePrimitives` test cases, which showed incorrect compiler behavior when the `process_closure_primitives` flag was toggled. The fix involves directly assigning `closurePass` from `flags.process_closure_primitives`, ensuring correct configuration of compiler options in alignment with the flag's intent.
