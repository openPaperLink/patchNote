The bug arises from improper handling of nested property accesses due to the original code's inability to process multiple levels of property chaining, assuming only a single `GetProp` level. This results in incorrect assignment recognition, affecting optimization and potentially leading to unexpected behaviors. Evidence of this issue is found in unit tests, such as `testIssue1017`, which fail when processing chained property accesses like `x = x.parentNode.parentNode;`. The fix involves implementing a loop to traverse `GetProp` nodes recursively, ensuring correct iteration over the entire property chain, which allows accurate `isNameAssignedTo` checks.
