The bug in the `Complex` class's `equals` method is caused by using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits` for comparison, resulting in a bitwise rather than value comparison. This can lead to incorrect inequalities due to different floating-point representations, particularly with cases like negative zeros or NaN values. Consequently, the method may incorrectly return false for mathematically equivalent `Complex` numbers, affecting logical checks and tests expecting equality. Evidence of this bug is shown in `testMath221`, where the method fails to assert equality for `Complex` numbers. The fix involves replacing the bitwise comparisons with straightforward `==` checks for the `real` and `imaginary` parts, ensuring correct numeric equality recognition.
