The bug in the `TypeCheck` class was caused by the incorrect handling of object literal keys, where the code mistakenly attempted to enforce types on them, although they are not meant to be type-checked. This led to unintended effects, such as inaccurate type information and false positives during type checks, where non-existent type mismatches could be reported. Evidence is found in test cases like `testGetTypedPercent5` and `testGetTypedPercent6`, which assess the typing of object literals and show issues with incorrect type application. The fix involves modifying the logic to set `typeable` to false for object literal keys, ensuring they are correctly marked as non-typeable and preventing any incorrect type enforcement.
