The bug is caused by insufficient condition checks when processing `goog.require` calls, specifically when the original condition `if (provided != null)` only detaches nodes if a `goog.provide` is found, ignoring scenarios where require checks are enabled but provides are not available. The consequence is that with certain require checks turned on, errors in requires may not be addressed on the first pass, potentially allowing erroneous code to persist through further compilation stages, leading to runtime errors or incorrect module dependencies. Evidence of this issue is visible in the `testNoUndeclaredVarWhenUsingClosurePass` test, which likely fails because the `goog.require('namespace.Class1')` call does not trigger the expected `ProcessClosurePrimitives.MISSING_PROVIDE_ERROR`. The fix modifies the condition to include `requiresLevel.isOn()`, ensuring nodes are detached when require checks are active, thus catching errors even if a corresponding provide is missing and maintaining code correctness.
