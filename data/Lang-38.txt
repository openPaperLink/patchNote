The bug was caused by not calling `getTime()` on the calendar object before cloning it when `mTimeZoneForced` is true, leading to uninitialized internal state and incorrect date-time formatting when time zones are forced. The consequence was erroneous date-time outputs in certain conditions, notably when a calendar initially set to one timezone was formatted with a different forced timezone. Evidence is provided by the `testLang538` unit test, which fails when the calendar's state is improperly initialized, leading to incorrect formatting. The fix requires calling `getTime()` to resolve any pending state calculations before cloning, ensuring accurate formatting.
