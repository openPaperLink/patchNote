The bug is caused by using `equals()` to compare `BigDecimal` objects in Java, which requires both numeric equivalence and identical scales, resulting in objects like `2.0` and `2.00` being considered unequal. This leads to incorrect behavior in the `EqualsBuilder` class, affecting any logic relying on it to compare `BigDecimal` values accurately, as demonstrated by the `testBigDecimal` unit test which fails to assert equality for `2.0` and `2.00`. The fix involves using `compareTo` for `BigDecimal` comparisons to properly handle numerical equivalence without regard to scale, ensuring correct functionality in `EqualsBuilder`.
