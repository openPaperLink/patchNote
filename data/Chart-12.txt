The bug arises from directly assigning the `dataset` parameter to the instance variable without using `setDataset`, which handles event and listener management. This can lead to listeners not being registered correctly, causing the `MultiplePiePlot` not to update visually when the data changes, as the `datasetChanged` event isn't triggered. Evidence of this bug is seen in the `testConstructor` unit test, which expects a listener to be attached upon initialization but fails if `setDataset` isn't used. The fix involves replacing the direct assignment with a call to `setDataset` to ensure proper listener management and event propagation, maintaining the plot's visual integrity when datasets are modified.
