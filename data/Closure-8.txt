The bug in the original code was caused by failing to exclude function parameters from being collapsed into variable declarations, as the method did not check if a variable was a named parameter. This could result in incorrect behavior where parameters might be treated as local variables, leading to unexpected reassignments or overrides of parameter values. Evidence of this is found in the "testIssue820" test, which demonstrates that function parameters like `a` were mistakenly collapsed with local variables `b` and `c`. The fix involved introducing the `isNamedParameter` method to ensure that named parameters are excluded from collapsing, preserving their intended scope and behavior within the function.
