The bug arises from using an inefficient method to compute the square root of diagonal matrices by relying on EigenDecomposition, which is unnecessarily complex for this case. This inefficiency leads to significant computational overhead, particularly with large matrices, impacting performance during extensive operations, such as those in "testLargeSample," although it doesn't affect the result's correctness. Evidence of this inefficiency comes from the inherent mathematical operations with diagonal matrices and the complexity of EigenDecomposition. The fix involves optimizing by checking if the input matrix is a DiagonalMatrix and individually computing the square roots of its diagonal elements, thereby improving performance by reducing computational complexity.
