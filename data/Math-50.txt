The bug in the `BaseSecantSolver` class arose from a flawed condition check when using the Regula Falsi method, where a superfluous logic under the case statement adjusted `x0` and recomputed `f0` based on `x == x1`. This unnecessary modification disrupted the solver's convergence behavior, potentially leading to inaccurate results and, in edge cases, causing the solver to fail in finding the root. Evidence of this issue was provided by failures in the `testIssue631`, highlighting inaccuracies in root calculations with the erroneous code. The fix involved removing this incorrect segment, ensuring correct operation of the Regula Falsi method without unnecessary disruptions, aligning with theoretical expectations.
