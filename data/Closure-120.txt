The bug arises from missing scope consistency validation in the code logic, allowing references with mismatched scopes to be processed, which can lead to incorrect analysis or operations on variables. The consequences include potential errors in variable handling, such as incorrect variable inlining, reordering, or generating warnings due to incorrect scope assumptions, which may disrupt optimization passes such as accurately disambiguating property names or marking code as dead. Evidence of the bug's impact is highlighted by tests like `testExternalIssue1053`, showing faulty behavior in assignments and comparisons when scope alignment is incorrect. The fix involves introducing a crucial check `if (ref.getSymbol().getScope() != ref.scope)` to ensure that processing stops if there's a scope mismatch, thereby preventing errors based on incorrect scope assumptions.
