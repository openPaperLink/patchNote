The bug arises from the lack of handling for the special case where multiplying `Long.MIN_VALUE` by `-1` causes an overflow, as this operation exceeds the range representable by a `long` in Java. The consequences are severe, leading to incorrect calculation results and critical misrepresentations of data, which may propagate through computations, causing cascading failures in systems reliant on precise calculations. Evidence of the issue is captured in unit tests, where `FieldUtils.safeMultiply(Long.MIN_VALUE, -1)` failed to throw an `ArithmeticException` initially but now correctly does so after the patch. The fix entails adding a check for `val1` being `Long.MIN_VALUE` and `val2` being `-1`, throwing an `ArithmeticException` to signal that the multiplication cannot be performed safely, hence preventing overflow and ensuring accurate arithmetic operations.
