The bug in the `PeepholeFoldConstants` class arises from flawed iteration logic that fails to correctly handle side effects for nodes in an array-like construct. Specifically, the original loop incorrectly bypasses checking for side effects for nodes except those before `intIndex`, leading to improper node transformations. Consequently, the optimizer may incorrectly assume certain operations have no side effects, resulting in unexpected JavaScript behavior or errors due to inappropriate expression transformations. Evidence of this issue is found in the `testFoldGetElem` unit test, highlighting invalid and boundary cases. The fix involves adjusting the logic to evaluate side effects for all nodes and only proceed if the node at `intIndex` has no side effects, ensuring functional correctness and expected code behavior.
