The bug in the `PolygonsSet` class is caused by a missing null check for the cut sub-hyperplane in the `tree` object during its attribute evaluation. Without this check, when a `PolygonsSet` object is initialized without vertices or boundaries, it incorrectly assumes the region spans the entire space if the tree is a leaf node with a null cut. This leads to incorrect geometric computations, like calculating size or barycenter, affecting operations dependent on these properties. Evidence of this issue is seen in unit tests, such as `testIssue780`, which verify geometric properties against expected values but fail due to improper infinite size assumptions. The fix involves adding a check for `tree.getCut() == null` in the conditional statement, ensuring proper identification of infinite-space-covering instances only when the tree node has no cut and the attribute indicates total space coverage.
