The bug in the `CodeGenerator` class is due to the incorrect handling of ASCII characters; it mistakenly includes the character at 0x7f, a non-printable DEL character, in its pass-through condition. This can cause improperly encoded JavaScript strings, leading to syntax or logic errors in environments that don't handle non-printable characters well. Evidence of this issue is shown in the `testUnicode` unit test, which highlights incorrect outcomes when the 0x7f character is involved, such as generating `\[\\u007f\]`. The fix involves changing the condition from `c <= 0x7f` to `c < 0x7f`, preventing the direct passage of the 0x7f character and ensuring it is correctly escaped. This ensures proper encoding and prevents misinterpretation by JavaScript parsers.
