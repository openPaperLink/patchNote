The bug in the `XYSeries` class arises from incorrect handling of the `addOrUpdate` method when `allowDuplicateXValues` is set to true. The code mistakenly checked `index >= 0 && !this.allowDuplicateXValues`, leading to unnecessary processing of existing items even when duplicates should be allowed. This results in inefficiencies, potential overwriting, loss of intended duplicates, and incorrect item counts, impacting data integrity and analysis reliant on accurate XY data sequences. Evidence of the bug is seen in test cases like `testBug1955483`, where duplicate X values did not behave as expected, failing to maintain multiple entries. The fix involves directly adding new data items without unnecessary checks when duplicates are permitted, aligning with intended series functionality and ensuring consistent handling of duplicate X values.
