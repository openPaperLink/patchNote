The bug arises from the incorrect calculation and validation of `endIndex`. The original condition only checks if `endIndex < 0` to determine an `emptyRange`, neglecting cases where `endIndex` is valid but less than `startIndex`, thus resulting in an invalid range. This oversight prevents proper identification of empty or invalid date ranges for `TimeSeries` copy operations, leading to potential exceptions, incorrect data manipulation, or data corruption when valid ranges are assumed. Evidence of this issue is highlighted in the `testBug1864222` test case, which fails under certain conditions due to incorrect range handling. The patch fixes this by updating the condition to `(endIndex < 0) || (endIndex < startIndex)`, ensuring `emptyRange` is correctly flagged for both invalid and logically erroneous `endIndex` values, thus preserving data integrity in `TimeSeries` operations.
