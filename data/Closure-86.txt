The bug arises from the incorrect assumption that certain Node types, particularly constructor functions, always have local side effects, leading to a premature return of `true`. This causes the compiler to misidentify functions or expressions as having side effects, limiting optimizations like dead code elimination and function inlining. Evidence for this issue is seen in test cases such as `testLocalizedSideEffects8` and `testIssue303`, where functions are wrongly marked due to this logic. The fix is to change the return value from `true` to `false`, ensuring constructors are flagged for side effects only when appropriate, improving the compiler's optimization capabilities by accurately identifying constructs without side effects.
