The bug in `PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax` was due to its logic allowing optimizations of conditional expressions without considering side effects in the condition (`cond`) when the right-hand side (`thenOp`) involved assignments to names. This oversight led to incorrect optimizations, risking behavior changes in JavaScript execution by potentially altering operations with side effects. The patch addressed this by adding a condition check: `(!mayHaveSideEffects(cond) || (thenOp.isAssign() && thenOp.getFirstChild().isName()))`, ensuring optimizations are applied only when the condition is side-effect-free or aligns with an assignment to a name. The fix's validity is confirmed by `testIssue925`, which demonstrates preservation of execution semantics.
