The bug occurs because `millis` is calculated without re-evaluating the impact of each `savedFields` on preceding field values when `resetFields` is true, which can lead to inaccurate date calculations due to fields influencing each other, such as overlapping date components like weeks and months. As a consequence, parsing certain date strings can yield incorrect `LocalDate` values, particularly in test cases like `testParseLocalDate_weekyear_month_week_2011`, where the expected `LocalDate` does not match the parsed result. This is evident from test failures where specific dates parsed from strings do not meet expectations. The patch fixes the bug by adding a block that re-iterates over `savedFields` when `resetFields` is true, ensuring each field is set with consideration for interactions with other fields, thus correcting the parsed results.
