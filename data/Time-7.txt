The bug was caused by incorrectly determining the default year using the adjusted local time with a time zone offset instead of the UTC-based instant time, leading to discrepancies during time zone boundary transitions or daylight saving changes. This resulted in incorrect parsing of date strings, particularly when handling critical time boundaries like leap year days or daylight saving transitions, often leading to dates being parsed into the wrong year. Unit tests, such as `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29_newYork_startOfYear` and `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29_tokyo_endOfYear`, provided evidence of this issue by failing to parse February 29th correctly across different time zones. The fix involved recalculating the `defaultYear` using the UTC-based instant time with `DateTimeUtils.getChronology(chrono).year().get(instantMillis)`, ensuring accurate year determination regardless of local time adjustments and aligning the parsing logic with the intended time representation.
