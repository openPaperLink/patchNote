The bug was caused by using `Precision.compareTo(entry, 0d, maxUlps)`, which is intended for a specific type of floating-point equality check, rather than a general-purpose error tolerance. This led to entries that were mathematically close to zero being incorrectly classified as positive. The consequences included incorrect elimination or retention of tableau columns in the simplex optimization process, resulting in infeasible or incorrect solutions due to floating-point precision errors. The evidence for this issue was demonstrated in the test `testMath781`, where precision mismatches led to assertion failures and suboptimal solutions. To fix the bug, the comparison was changed to use `Precision.compareTo(entry, 0d, epsilon)`, which provides a more appropriate and consistent error tolerance for numerical computations close to zero.
