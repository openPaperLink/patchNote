The bug in the `ShapeList` class occurs because the `equals` method relies on `super.equals(obj)`, which does not consider the specifics of `Shape` equality, potentially resulting in incorrect equality checks. Consequently, this can lead to logical errors in applications that depend on accurate `ShapeList` comparisons, like incorrect data handling or visual representations. Evidence of this issue is seen in the `testEquals` test case, where `ShapeList` instances with identical shapes are expected to be equal, but this was not guaranteed with the original implementation. The fix involves overriding the `equals` method to iterate over the elements and use `ShapeUtilities.equal` for precise `Shape` comparisons, ensuring accurate equality checks.
