The bug in the code arises from miscalculating time zone offsets during daylight saving time transitions, particularly in autumn when clocks are set back, leading to one-hour time discrepancies due to incorrect handling of overlapping local times. This issue is evidenced in test cases like `test_getOffsetFromLocal_Moscow_Autumn`, where timezone offset handling through DST transitions can lead to erroneous wall-times. The fix involves adjusting the logic to handle positive `offsetLocal` scenarios by utilizing `previousTransition` to correct the offset based on overlap periods, ensuring accurate offset representation during these transitions.
