The bug arises from missing a condition to ensure properties are not collapsed if they are from externs. This oversight can cause incorrect collapsing of properties in externs, leading to misrepresentation or loss of functionality for externally defined variables. Evidence of the issue is observed in the test case `testIssue931`, which fails when `collapsePropertiesOnExternTypes` is true, indicating the problem with global extern properties. The fix involves adding a check for `name.inExterns` before collapsing properties, preserving the integrity of external references.
