The bug in `CodeConsumer.java` was caused by incorrect handling of comment syntax during code generation, specifically failing to insert a necessary space when a forward-slash character appeared after another forward-slash, indicating the start of a comment (`//`). This led to malformed JavaScript code, where division operations could incorrectly merge with comment syntax, causing runtime syntax errors and potentially causing JavaScript applications to fail.

Evidence of this issue can be seen in test cases like `testIssue620`, where alerts involving regular expressions demonstrated that omitting a space between division operations and comments resulted in invalid JavaScript code. The assertion `assertPrint("alert(/ // / /);","alert(/ // / /)");` highlights the need for space insertion to maintain valid syntax.

The fix involved adding a condition that checks when a forward-slash follows another, using `append(" ");` to insert a space and prevent merging, thereby preserving correct JavaScript syntax.
