The bug was caused by the lack of filtering in the template types inference process. The original code directly populated the `inferred` map from `inferTemplateTypesFromParameters(fnType, n)`, which led to the inclusion of unrelated template types and inaccurate type inference. This resulted in misbehavior when handling complex template type scenarios, such as those with mixed or inherited templates, leading to incorrect type replacements and failures in tests like `testTemplatized11` and `testIssue1058`. These tests highlighted incorrect typing outputs due to the inappropriate mapping of template types.

The fix involved adding a filtering mechanism using `Maps.filterKeys` with a predicate to ensure only relevant `TemplateType` keys are considered. This approach narrowed template inference to applicable types, ensuring precise type replacements and aligning with function arguments and expected outputs, thus resolving the inconsistencies in the type inference system.
