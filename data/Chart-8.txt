The bug was caused by constructing the `Week` object with a fixed `DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE` instead of using the specified `TimeZone` argument. This led to issues when users expected the `Week` object to adhere to the specified `TimeZone`, causing errors in week calculations based on the incorrect timezone settings. Evidence of the issue was found in failing unit tests, where `Week` objects created with specific timezones showed mismatches in week numbers. For example, discrepancies arose with the Denmark locale, where Monday is the first day of the week, calculated under the `Europe/Copenhagen` timezone, due to inconsistent timezone handling. The fix involves modifying the constructor to use the provided `TimeZone` argument, ensuring consistent week calculations aligned with user specifications.
