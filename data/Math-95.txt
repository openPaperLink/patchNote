The bug was caused by the lack of an initial value assignment for the variable `ret` when `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()` returned a value less than or equal to 2.0, leading to uninitialized `ret` and unpredictable behavior or exceptions in `getInitialDomain()`. This resulted in incorrect domain calculations, as evidenced by the test case `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom`, which failed when the denominator degrees of freedom was set to 1.0 and 2.0. To fix this, the developers initialized `ret` to 1.0, ensuring it always has a valid numeric value and preventing uninitialized or erroneous results, thus aligning the method with correct statistical calculations for F-distributions.
