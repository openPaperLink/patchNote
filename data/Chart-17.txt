The bug in the `TimeSeries` class arises from the `clone` method originally using `createCopy`, which did not deeply clone the `data` list, resulting in shared references between the original and cloned objects. Consequently, changes to the `data` list in either instance would affect the other, violating the principle of a distinct clone and leading to unintended data alterations and inconsistent behavior during tests. Evidence of this issue is found in the `testBug1832432` unit test, where the cloned object becomes unequal to the original after modifications, indicating shared data references. The fix is to use `ObjectUtilities.deepClone` to ensure the `data` list is deeply cloned, creating a separate instance for the clone and resolving the bug by preventing shared references.
