The bug in `MannWhitneyUTest.java` arises from the incorrect variable type for the product `n1 * n2`. It was declared as an `int`, which can overflow with large datasets, resulting in incorrect, potentially negative values. This affects the Mann-Whitney U test results for large dataset sizes, as multiplication overflow can lead to unreliable statistical outcomes, such as inaccurate expected U statistic calculations. Evidence of this problem is seen in `testBigDataSet`, which uses arrays of size 1500, where the computation could overflow with `int` type but remains accurate with `double`. The fix involves changing the type of `n1n2prod` from `int` to `double`, preventing overflow and ensuring correctness for large datasets, aligning with required precision for mathematical operations.
