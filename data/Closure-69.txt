The bug in the original code arises from incorrect assumptions about the invocation context for functions with explicit 'this' types in the `TypeCheck` class. The code fails to ensure these functions are invoked through permissible contexts like `GETPROP` or `GETELEM`, leading to potential runtime errors or logical inconsistencies.

The consequences include inaccuracies in static analysis and unexpected behaviors in type-checked JavaScript code, where 'this' type constraints might not be enforced. This mismatch between expectations and execution context is confirmed by test cases such as `testThisTypeOfFunction4`, `testThisTypeOfFunction3`, and `testThisTypeOfFunction2`, which reveal violations of expected type constraints.

The fix involves adding checks to ensure ordinary functions with explicit 'this' types are appropriately called through `GETPROP` or `GETELEM`. If not, a warning is issued using `report()` with the `EXPECTED_THIS_TYPE` diagnostic, reinforcing adherence to these type constraints and preventing runtime issues.
